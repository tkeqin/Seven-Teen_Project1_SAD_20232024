# 6.0 Summary of Requirement Analysis process


The current AS-IS of the LibraSync system was completed by implementing several functions. These functions are as below:

AS-IS System Analysis

1. Common and Basic Search Capability
 - Provides general search functionality.
 - Lack of advanced filtering options.
2. Limited Searching for the Book Status
 - Allows users to check the status of books physically.
3. Simple Overdue Books and Reserving/Borrowing/Returning System
 - Basic tracking of overdue books.
 - Difficulty in updating information about students and books.
4. Security and Access Control
 - Basic security measures.
 - Having difficulties in handling data loss.
   
These functions need to be changed to become a good and efficient system for users to use. The AS-IS system can be changed to automate so that it can minimize human error and provide ease for the users.

TO-BE System Requirements

1. Additional search capabilities
 - Implement advanced filters such as author, publication date, language.
2. Online Reservation System
 - Allow users to reserve books online, view the availability of books in 
   real-time, and receive notifications for pickup.
3. Automated Check-In and Check-Out System
 - Automate the borrowing and returning process, reducing manual errors and 
   improving efficiency.
4. Automated Record Management
 - Implement an automated system to process the addition, updating, and 
   removal of records and ensure the database is always up-to-date and 
   accurate.
 - Simplify the input process by library staff and link it to the library 
   records.
5. Data backup and security
 - Implement regular backups to secure data from loss or corruption. Able to 
   recover the lost or altered data.
   
In conclusion, the transformation of the old LibraSync system to the proposed system requires a thorough understanding of current functionalities and areas for improvement. The functional and non-functional requirements as mentioned before play important roles in this transformation. The new TO-BE system will provide an efficient, and user-friendly experience where human errors can be reduced and enhance overall library management operations.
