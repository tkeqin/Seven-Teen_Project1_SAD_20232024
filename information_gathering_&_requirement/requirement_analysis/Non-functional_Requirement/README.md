### 5.3 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

***Performance***

1. Advanced search capability
   
   - The library management system has been updated and improved by using advanced search capabilities, which make our system more efficient and complex. By using this feature, it can help users search for their desired 
     items more easily and conveniently. Users can search their books via the publication date, language, and type of the books to allow the system to accurately detect the location of the books. After searching, the 
     location of the user's desired book will be immediately displayed at the interface of the system.
     
2. Website access
   
   - The website of the library management system is easy to use and loads quickly on any device and browser, so users can navigate faster and more easily. The users need to login to the website by using their 
     matriculation number and password to ensure access is restricted to authorized personnel and protect other users. Besides, the website keeps running faster and smoothly when a lot of users access it without any 
     crashing or problems, and it makes sure everyone can access it anytime. The speed of the website is optimized to avoid slowing down the system and allow the users to access our website swiftly and have a great 
     experience while using it.
 
3. Real-time book status updates
   
   - The system interface will show a notification whether a book is available or not and show the book status, such as whether the book has been reserved, after the user searches. The system will update the book's 
     status immediately when it changes to let the users know the latest status of the book.
 
4. Automated notifications for overdue books and the reservation system
   
   - For the users who kept and borrowed the books for a long period of time, even if the books were overdue, the system will automatically generate a notification to remind them to return the books on time. Similar to 
     the users who reserved the books, after the books are available, the system will update their status and send a notification immediately to allow the users to pick them up on time. Besides, the system will 
     automatically decide who gets priority for the reserved book to make sure it is fair for users.
---
***Control***
1.	Security and access control
    - The system uses strong passwords and encryption to keep the users information safe and avoid any hacker or unauthorized access. Only the users who get access to the system are able to use the website. Besides, the 
      system will always be updated and undergo automatic regular checks to make sure it is in safe condition and give the harm a wide berth. Furthermore, the library management system will stop anyone from using the 
      system without permission. Other than that, the system will automatically log out after the user leaves their computer logged in. This can prevent other people from using their account without permission.
 
2.	Data control
    - The system will make sure that the data, such as information about the users, information about the books, and so on, is stored correctly. The system will get the data back if something goes wrong or data is lost. 
      Besides, the system will regularly check to make sure every piece of data is still of good quality and get rid of redundant data.
