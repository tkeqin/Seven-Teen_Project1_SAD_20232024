### 5.3 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

***Performance***

1. Search capability
   
   - The searching capability in the library management system function was very common and basis. Users can only find their desired books by searching the book's name or author which makes it more difficult for them to find the specific books. They also need to speed up their search time because there are a lot of similar titles. Therefore, the system cannot quickly locate the desired books they want. The old system does not have the options to filter searches by language, book type, and so on to let users find their books more efficiently.
     
2. Website access
   
   - The website of the library management system was a bit messy when used, and sometimes during peak times when many users wanted to access it, the website would become slow to load and at the same time the system would crash. The users need to login to the website by using their UTMID and password to ensure access is restricted to authorized personnel and protect other users.

 
3. Book status 
   
   - The library management system did not immediately provide the real-time book status updates.Therefore the users need to wait some times for the updated or can check it by going to library.This will cause the users confusing about the books status whether the books was reserved , available or checked out.
 
4. Automated notifications for overdue books and the reservation system
   
   - For the users who kept and borrowed the books for a long period of time, even if the books were overdue, the system will automatically generate a notification to remind them to return the books on time. Similar to 
     the users who reserved the books, after the books are available, the system will update their status and send a notification immediately to allow the users to pick them up on time. Besides, the system will 
     automatically decide who gets priority for the reserved book to make sure it is fair for users.
---
***Control***
1.	Security and access control
    - The system uses strong passwords and encryption to keep the users information safe and avoid any hacker or unauthorized access. Only the users who get access to the system are able to use the website. Besides, the 
      system will always be updated and undergo automatic regular checks to make sure it is in safe condition and give the harm a wide berth. Furthermore, the library management system will stop anyone from using the 
      system without permission. Other than that, the system will automatically log out after the user leaves their computer logged in. This can prevent other people from using their account without permission.
 
2.	Data control
    - The system will make sure that the data, such as information about the users, information about the books, and so on, is stored correctly. The system will get the data back if something goes wrong or data is lost. 
      Besides, the system will regularly check to make sure every piece of data is still of good quality and get rid of redundant data.
