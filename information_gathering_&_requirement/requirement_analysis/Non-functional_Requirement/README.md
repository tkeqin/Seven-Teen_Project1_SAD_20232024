### 5.3 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

***Performance***

1. Search capability
   
   - The searching capability in the library management system function was very common and basis. Users can only find their desired books by searching the book's name or author which makes it more difficult for them to find the specific books. They also need to speed up their search time because there are a lot of similar titles. Therefore, the system cannot quickly locate the desired books they want. The old system does not have the options to filter searches by language, book type, and so on to let users find their books more efficiently.
     
2. Website access
   
   - The website of the library management system was a bit messy when used, and sometimes during peak times when many users wanted to access it, the website would become slow to load and at the same time the system would crash. The users need to login to the website by using their UTMID and password to ensure access is restricted to authorized personnel and protect other users.

 
3. Book status 
   
   - The library management system only provide the books status that is available or not available only.The system did not mentioned the books is already reserved or already checked out and did not immediately provide the real-time book status updates.Therefore the users need to wait some times for the updated or can check it by going to library.This will cause the users confusing about the books status whether the books was reserved , available or checked out.
 
4. Overdue books and the reserving / borrowing / returning system
   
   - The reserve system of the library management system can only reserve the books that have been borrowed. The system cannot borrow and return the book in the library management system. It needs users to go to the UTM library and use the self-checkin Machine in the UTM library. For the users who kept and borrowed the books for a long period of time, even if the books were overdue, the system will not generate a notification to remind them to return the books on time. Similar to the users who reserved the books, after the books are available, the system will not update their status and send a notification immediately to allow the users to pick them up on time.

***Control***
1.	Security and access control
    - The system had a weak security and eaiser for unauthorized people to access. This mean that the system did not uses strong passwords and encryption to keep the users information safe and avoid any hacker or unauthorized access.Not only the users who get access to the system are able to use the website.
 
2.	Data control
    - The data in the system is not really stable.Sometimes, the data will lost or rebundant because the system didn't check the data and do the maintenance. Therefore, when the data is lost ,the system cannot quickly get back the data.
