# 1.0 Overview of the Project

<p align="justify">In Phase 2, our objective is to determine human information requirements for the project and analyze the system needs. We are using Google Forms which is a type of questionnaire to get input from stakeholders including students, librarians, and library staff. We are using open-ended questions and closed questions along with nominal and interval queries to get useful information from the stakeholders. This project will enhance our understanding of the 4W1H aspects of the current system ensuring thorough knowledge of the people, goals, data, and procedures involved. This phase is used to help the analyst know how to make the new system more useful and usable.

Next, we developed a data flow diagram based on the information that we gathered through the questionnaires. A data flow diagram can visually represent the business flow of the current e-Commerce Business system. Data flow diagrams are graphically illustrating the data processed and flows within a business system.

Data flow diagrams consist of context diagrams, parent diagrams, and child diagrams. The context diagram provides a high-level overview, which shows the data flow between system entities. The parent diagram is known as the extension of the context diagram which includes all entities, data flows, processes, and data stores. Finally, child diagrams include all the parent diagram's inputs and outputs in a more detailed way as they may consist of additional processes and data stores.

After the completion of Phase 2, we have gained a deep understanding of the current system such as the information requirements and data flow diagrams.
