# 4.1.1 Interview
The interview is conducted with Ms. Loy, the head librarian to understand the requirements of the current library management system. We arranged the interview questions using funnel structure to provide an easy, non-threatening way to begin our interview.

## Question 1: How do students search for desired books?
Students must know the full title of the book to be able to use the search function in the system for locating the books. On the other way, students have to search manually on the book racks if he/she does not know the complete title of books. 

## Question 2: How do student check for the availability of books
Students can only visit library during opening hours and working days to check for the availability of books. This makes the checking process troublesome and time-consuming. 

## Question 3: How do students check in and check out a book?
To check in and check out a book requires the help of librarian because the current system does not support self kiosks. Students have to cooperate with librarian working hours to be able to borrow or return books.

## Question 4: How does the current system update information?
The current library management system requires librarian staff to update any new information manually as the system is not linked to a database. It needs a lot of human resources to get updates done.
 
## Question 5: Did you face any problems or experience any inconvenience in the current system before? What are they?
Yes, I’ve encountered some problems. One of the main problems is that overdue fines are not applied correctly due to the delay of status updates which makes students confused. Second, the search function accuracy have to be improved as it sometimes leads to incorrect results. Furthermore, the availability of books shown in the system is delayed which reduces the reliability of system.

## Question 6: Are there any key features that you feel are missing from the current system?
I think the current system lacks automated features and a 24-hour accessible online platform for reservation and checking availability purposes. These two features are always complained about by our students also. By using an automated system, librarians can focus on other aspects to help students as the check-in and check-out process can be independent from librarians. 

## Question 7: Would you say the current system meets the majority of the library’s requirement?
No. I don’t think so. The current system has been used for 20 years which is outdated. There are a lot of new technologies that can be implemented to ease the operation.
