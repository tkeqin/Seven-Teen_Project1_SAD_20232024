## 2.0 Background Study
   		In the past, the library management system at the University Technology Malaysia (UTM) operated using traditional methods. Users were limited to searching for books by their titles and authors, which is inefficient and time-consuming. This restriction made it difficult for users to access resources efficiently, leading to dissatisfaction among students.
    		Nowadays, the current UTM library management system is facing some issues. When people want to find a book, they can only search for it by its title and author. This means that if they don't remember the exact title, they need to spend more time to find the book they desire. Therefore, they end up spending more time searching and less time studying or teaching.
    		Besides, it is hard for users to find and use books effectively. The outdated search methods often get in the way when users are trying to look for relevant books for their studies. When users return books, the system sometimes doesn't record it right thus causing frustration. Fixing these issues is really important to make users happier and make the library better for everyone. In addition, data of certain return processes are not recorded, leading to inaccuracies in recording book returns. When the system fails to update these transactions, it causes confusion among users. In the old UTM library management system, sometimes errors occur in which the student has already returned the book but the system does not show it.
    		The new system plans to fix these problems by letting users search for books using more details like date and language. It also aims to make sure book returns are recorded accurately. These changes will make it easier for users to find what they need and trust the system more.
