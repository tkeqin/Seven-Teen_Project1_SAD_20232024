## 1.0 Introduction

   As students, the library becomes the most important part in a studentâ€™s life and it has been frequently used by students. A library provides students with vital resources for their studies. It is like a second home. It's where they go to find the books and resources they need for their studies. At University Technology Malaysia (UTM), the library management system has become an integral tool for students. This system serves several key functions which is storing students' record of book borrowing and returning.
    		In the UTM library management system, users need to login to the system before using it. By implementing a user login process, the UTM library management system ensures that access to its resources is controlled, secure, and aligned with the university's policies and procedures. This approach enhances the overall user experience and contributes to the efficient operation of the library's services.
    		Over time, user satisfaction with the UTM library management system decreased due to its old and outdated functions. Users reported spending excessive amounts of time navigating the old system in search of specific books. Due to the absence of comprehensive search functionalities and user-friendly navigation, locating desired resources became a difficult process. As a result, there is a decline in the number of students who prefer using the UTM library management system nowadays.
    		Having a good library system is very crucial because it helps students succeed. When everything is organized and easy to find, students can spend less time looking for books and more time studying. Additionally, it makes sure that everyone gets a fair chance to borrow the books they need. To prevent users from spending most of their time searching and hunting for books required, we would be adding some features to the UTM library management system to enhance user satisfaction and improve our system. In the previous UTM library management system, it only can find the books by searching their books titles and authors. Now, in the new system, we will be adding some new search filters, such as date of publication and language used. This new system would help users to spend less time finding the books they desire and spend their time on more important tasks in their lives.
