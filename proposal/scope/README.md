LibraSync is a library management system that is designed to help users to access the library     management system in terms of borrowing books, returning books, checking book availability, and managing user accounts for those with special access. LibraSync is implemented by us to ensure the accurate storage of information and to provide users with a better experience when using the library system.

   LibraSync has met the objectives of providing a searching system with additional features such as allowing users to use publication dates to search for the desired book. The new check-in and check-out system ensures that every piece of data is stored correctly inside the system. Next, LibraSync makes improvements in checking the availability status of books more effectively online. Hence, if the book is out of stock, students no longer need to run to the libraryï¼Œ wasting time and effort only to find nothing. Besides, it constantly updates the information of users and books to ensure that all information is up to date. LibraSync also provides users with a secure database which helps to avoid data leakage and data loss.

      The stakeholders involved in this system could be divided into three types of users such as students, staff which includes lecturers, and outsiders. Each category has its own corresponding management system to tailor their needs in order to ensure a smooth operation and avoid errors. For students, they will have access to borrow and return books as well as search the availability of books. For staff, they will have the access to manage library resources such as book availability and user accounts. For outsiders, they can only search for the available resources and return the book on the same day.
